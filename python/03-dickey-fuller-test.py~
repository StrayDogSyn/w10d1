# Notice how the decomposition reveals:
#     • A slight warming trend over the years
#     • Clear seasonal patterns (summer vs winter)
#     • Random variations after removing trend and seasonality"
# Understanding Stationarity:
# "For many time series models, especially ARIMA, we need our data to be 'stationary'. This means:
#     • Constant mean over time
#     • Constant variance over time
#     • No seasonal patterns
# Why? Because it's much easier to model and predict stationary data. Let's check if our temperature data is stationary:"
