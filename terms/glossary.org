- *ARIMA*: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model combining
  past values and errors
- *Stationarity*: Property where statistical properties don't change
  over time
- *Differencing*: Subtracting consecutive observations to achieve
  stationarity
- *Autocorrelation*: Correlation of a time series with its own lagged
  values
- *Partial Autocorrelation*: Correlation between observations at
  different lags, removing intermediate effects
- *Seasonal Decomposition*: Separating time series into trend,
  seasonal, and residual components
- *ACF Plot*: Autocorrelation Function plot showing correlation at
  different lags
- *PACF Plot*: Partial Autocorrelation Function plot for model order
  selection
- *AIC/BIC*: Information criteria for model selection (lower is
  better)
- *Residual Analysis*: Checking if model errors are random and
  normally distributed
